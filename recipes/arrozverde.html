<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Arroz verde is normally made with poblano peppers. My family likes spicy food so I have elevated the heat in this green rice by using Hatch chiles. If you are sensitive to heat, use poblano peppers.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 Hatch green chiles</li>

    <li>1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth</li>

    <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

    <li>1 cup long grain rice</li>

    <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>

    <li>2 large garlic cloves, pressed</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon, such as KnorrÂ®</li>

    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

    <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place Hatch chiles directly on the grates of a gas stove. Cook over medium heat, flipping with tongs occasionally, until blackened and charred, about 5 minutes. Place in a sealed plastic bag and allow to cool, 7 to 8 minutes. </li>

    <li>Peel off charred skins; remove seeds. Place chiles, chicken broth and cilantro in the jar of a blender and blend until smooth. Set aside.</li>

    <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until it shimmers; add rice and onion. Cook and stir until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken bouillon, salt, and cumin. Add chile mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until rice is tender, 25 to 30 minutes. </li>
</ol>
